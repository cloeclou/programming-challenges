This repository includes solutions to programming challenges found online 
completed with the objective of improving my programming skills and learning
new concepts and programming languages. Folders of this directory will be 
removed as soon as there is a relevant project written in that language which
can attest to my proficiency.

Programming challenges are mostly obtained from coderbyte.com and edabit.com. 
Other sources include: UofToronto's 'Learning How to Program: Crafting Quality 
Code' course.

Solutions have been developed by myself: they may not be optimal for the problem 
at hand, especially those solved when I just started out programming.
