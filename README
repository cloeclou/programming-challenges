This repository includes solutions to programming challenges found online 
completed with the objective of improving my programming skills and learning
new concepts and programming languages.

Programming challenges are mostly obtained from coderbyte.com. Other sources
incluse: UofToronto's 'Learning How to Program: Crafting Quality Code' course.

Solutions have been developed by myself: they may not be optimal for the problem 
at hand, especially those solved when I just started out programming.
